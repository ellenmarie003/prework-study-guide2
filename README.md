# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This is my personal study guide for the prework modules of the November 2024 University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. I built this webpage to serve as a working online documentation of important information I wanted to remember going through the Coding Bootcamp and to develop a foundational knowledge of what skills I would be learning over the next six months. I plan to add to this study guide and update it regularly not only with additional information, but with further skills that will be reflected in the evolving functionality of the webpage. I have begun to learn the language of this industry and a basis of the navigational skills involved in coding, and I look forward to learning more.
